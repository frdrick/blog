### Welcome
![alt text](/assets/home_page/banner.png)

I recently completed my studies at University, first studying BSc Maths and Economics and then MSc Data Science. As I continue to learn outside of University, I am keen to keep track of my progress - whether in Maths, Statistics, Game Theory, Programming, or the climate ect. Hopefully I can share some useful information with others at the same time.
