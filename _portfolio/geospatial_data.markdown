This year I began using geospatial data in projects for the first time. I started with ArcGIS Pro where I conducted an assessment of landslide susceptibility for the Tamzoura Municipality in Algeria. The project can be found here: [link to report on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/landslide-susceptibility-tamzoura-algeria).
